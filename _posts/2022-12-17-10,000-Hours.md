## A New Post
## I've heard many times, saw some YT videos on that if you want you master a skill, you have to put 10,000 hours in it. So, I want to become skilled at Computer Science and it by heart and soul. So, I am gonna put 10,000 hours. I am also streaming those 10,000 hours on YT. So, yeah peace out.
