Command Line Interface – CLI

GUI vs. CLI

GUI = A graphical user interface, where we have graphical elements that you can interact with, like buttons.

CLI = Command Line Interface, where users type in commands and see the results printed on the screen

Terminal = the GUI window that you see on the screen. It takes commands and shows output.


In terminal you would get this text, which means

luke@luke-virtual-machine:~$

luke-virtual-machine – computer name
luke - username
~ = home directory
$ - represents regular user
# - sign for root user


Commands

pwd = print working directory. It shows current directory

ls = List folders and files. ls shows the list of files and folders in the directory

cd[dir name] = Change directory to [dir]
rcsvs
cd - = It takes you back to the previous location

mkdir = make directory. It makes new folders.



touch [filename] = Create [filename]          e.g.  touch main.py
rm [filename] = Delete [filename]                e.g rm main.py

cd ..  = go up a directory


rm -r [dirname] = Delete a non-empty directory and all the files within it.
rm -d [dirname] or rmdir [dirname] = Delete an empty directory

clear = clears the terminal



EVERTHING in Linux is a File
	Text documents, Pictures etc.
	Directories
	Commands, like pwd, ls etc. These are referred as binary files.

cd [absolute path] = Move to any location by providing the full path

mv [filename] [new_filename] = Rename the file to a new filename
cp -r [dirname] [new_dirname] = Copy dirname to new_dirname

ls [dirname] = shows the contents of the directory
history = for history of commands
history 20 = it gives last twenty commands

ls -a = shows all files (including hidden files)

cat [filename] = Display the file content

To know and operate Linux you don’t need to know each and every command by heart!
You just need to know these 20 commands and you are good to go.


Why use CLI over GUI?

	Work more efficient
Instead of clicking through file system, work in 1 terminal  

	Easier for bulk operations

	CLI is more powerful



Execute commands as superuser
sudo = Allows regular users to run programs with the security privileges of the superuser or root
